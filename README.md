# Simple Task Manager (Python) by Vishall 

## Overview

This is a simple command-line **Task Manager** written in Python. The purpose of this project was to practice and learn several important concepts in Python programming. The project allows users to add, view, and remove tasks from a list. It was built to improve my understanding of:

- Defining functions in Python
- Using built-in methods like `append()`, `pop()`, and `len()`
- Handling errors with the `try` and `except` blocks
- Basic control flow with `if`, `else`, and `for` loops

This is a beginner-level project, focusing on the essential building blocks of Python. The application allows the user to perform basic operations on a list of tasks, all while handling user input and errors gracefully.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to your task list.
- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks currently in your task list.
- **Remove Tasks**: Remove a task from the list by selecting its number.
- **Error Handling**: The program includes error handling for invalid input, ensuring smooth user experience.

## What I Learned

In developing this task manager, I focused on:

1. **Defining Functions**: I created functions like `add_task()`, `view_tasks()`, and `remove_task()` to better understand how to structure Python programs with reusable code blocks.
   
2. **Using Built-in Methods**: I learned how to work with Python’s built-in list methods such as:
   - **`append()`** to add items to a list
   - **`pop()`** to remove items from a list based on an index
   - **`len()`** to find the number of tasks in the list

3. **Error Handling with Try and Except**: I learned how to handle potential errors (like entering invalid task numbers or non-numeric input) using `try` and `except`. This ensures the program doesn’t crash and provides helpful error messages to the user.

4. **Basic Control Flow**: I gained hands-on experience with conditional statements (`if`, `else`) and loops (`for`), allowing me to better understand how to control the flow of a program.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
